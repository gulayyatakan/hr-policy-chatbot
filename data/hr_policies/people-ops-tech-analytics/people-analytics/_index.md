## Overview

People Analytics uses data-driven insights to improve talent decisions and workforce processes at GitLab. We're part of the People Strategy team, helping inform People Group decisions at all organizational levels through reporting, data solutions, and statistical analysis.

## People Analytics Team Members

## Data Governance & Security

GitLab's commitment to transparency and efficiency extends to our data governance framework. The People Analytics team collaborates closely with People and Legal teams to ensure we only access data we are authorized to use. Our process includes access verification and stakeholder approval for all data requests, maintaining strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

**Core Governance Principles:**

- **Source System Priority** - People Group daily operations remain in ther source systems to maintain data integrity and workflow efficiency
- **Strategic Data Warehousing** - Our data warehouse, built on technologies like [dbt](/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/dbt-guide/) and [Snowflake](/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/snowflake/) is reserved for "up and out" organizational reporting and analytics
- **Data Minimization** - We only bring in the data needed in reporting and anonymize information whenever possible to protect individual privacy
- **Comprehensive Tracking** - We track data from source system to all downstream systems to understand and mitigate risk throughout the data lifecycle

This governance framework ensures that data remains consistent, reliable, and easy to work with while protecting sensitive information. For detailed information about our data governance processes, see our [Data Governance handbook page](data-governance.md).
